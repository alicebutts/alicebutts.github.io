_Stories about my animals prepare you for your life_

When Dad was six he thought the classroom hamster looked bored. He rolled her in the bottom of his shirt like he was a kangaroo, and the hamster his joey. He helicoptered himself around and around. The centripedal force spat the hamster out of the sides of Dad's shirt and straight into the wall. She died.

##### Bad things happen to good people

When I was six Mom decided the best anniversary gift a wife could give a husband was a dwarf hamster. Mom claims to this day she was not mad at Dad.

At first it seemed there wasn't much to the hamster, and that made it difficult to name. The only thing the hamster did was sleep in its small wooden house. The house didn't have a door, so my older sister decided Doorknob was an appropriate name. For this same reason we are called Butts.

We soon realized Doorknob was as mean-spirited a creature as we had ever met. It bit every hand that waved into its fish tank - every hand except our librarian Cheryl's. I don't remember what Cheryl was doing in our house, but I do remember she fed Doorknob seven cheerios.

##### If you want privacy all it takes is to be a rude, abonimable piece of ****
Of all our hamsters Doorknob lived the longest. No one, not even my murderer of a baby sister, dared to helicopter Doorknob in their shirts. So, even without a door, Doorknob had the most private room of the house.
